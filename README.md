# Getting Started

Often the most difficult and confusing aspect of application development is figuring out how to build a common framework for creating new applications. Over time, development teams have started using tools like Maven, Ant and Ivy to automate some of these functions. This plugin uses the Maven plugin for deploying Apigee bundles to the Edge platform. 

#### Why this deployment plugin is developed?

- Helps in offline development.
- Easy integrations with source control like git.
- The Maven build strategy is a good strategy if your current enterprise build and deploy strategies already use Maven or Maven compatible tools.
- Configuration management across organizations/environments.
(Realtime Enterprise Edge architecture consists of multiple organizations/environments and configurations which varies according to these. An example scenario for this use would be the Maven configuration file to replace the number of requests it takes to trip a spike arrest policy. In your non-production environment you may want this policy to take effect when 10 requests a minute is surpassed, in production you may want this policy to trip when 10000 requests a minute is surpassed.)



## Building API bundles

### What is an Apigee bundle? 

Apigee bundles can be described as a zipped file system composed of configuration, scripts and code. The file system when extracted is composed of the following structure.

|-apiproxy

  |---proxies

  |---resources

  |---policies

  |---targets


### Create a new API

Instructions for creating a new API can be found at this link

[http://apigee.com/docs/api-platform/content/add-and-configure-your-first-api](http://apigee.com/docs/api-platform/content/add-and-configure-your-first-api)

### Export your API

Instructions for exporting your API via an API can be found at this link

[http://apigee.com/docs/api/api\_methods/105-export-an-api](http://apigee.com/docs/api/api_methods/105-export-an-api)

To export you API via Apigee Edge select the organization that contains the proxy you wish to export. From the navigation bar on the top, under APIs select the API Proxies. Select the proxy, on the far left of the screen, under the drop down menu titled Project, select Download Current Revision.

## Steps to set it up 

Follow below steps to set up your local development environment

1. Create the folder structure as described in the  section
2. Create and configure pom files - Parent pom and the child pom for the proxy
3. Create and configure config.json - if there are environment specific configurations (This is an optional step)
  
And you are ready for deploy to Apigee Edge using the plugin


###Step 1 Create a Maven compatible file structure


Below is the recommended structure for the project. However only the folder structure below the folder gateway is mandatory 

|-name-of-root (typically company name)

 |---archive

 |-----docs

 |-----src

 |---binaries

 |---build-artifacts

 |---docs

 |-----customer

 |-----reference

 |-----solution

 |---src

 |-----analytics

 |-----gateway

** |-------parent-pom**

 |-------test-app

 |---------apiproxy

 |-----------proxies

 |-----------resources

 |-------------py

 |-----------policies

 |-----------targets

 |-----java

 |-----portal

 |---test


#### Decompress API Bundle

The API bundle will come zipped, use the unarchiving utility of your choice to unzip the file.

Once unzipped you will have a folder named apiproxy, this folder contains all of the configuration for your proxy and the folder structure needed for re-importing of the configuration.

The composition of the folder can be described as below.

{ApiName}.xml - A file that contains descriptors for the content

policies - A folder that contains xml policies

proxies - A folder that contains information about your proxy configurations (inbound)

targets - A folder that contains information about target configurations (outbound)

resources - A folder that contains any scripts (Java, js, and python)

Note: when creating scripts place your scripts in folders with the name of the script ext i.e. java, jsc, py



### Step 2 Create and configure pom files

In a standard configuration typically we have parent-pom (pom.xml inside the *parent-pom* directory) and a child pom (pom file at  the peer level as folder *apiproxy*).

Parent-pom: The contents of the parent pom folder will contain a single pom.xml file. This file typically contains most of the configuration of Maven and the plugin, it also contains credentials for the Apigee platform. In case of manual creating a Maven compatible file structure, "parent-pom" directory should be in perr level with customer application folders. Here we configure all the information whch is same acroos multiple apiproxys. Eg: Profile configurations which has the org/env info etc.

#### parent-pom-pom-xml Sample

Refer parent-pom template [parent-pom] (https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/forecastweatherapi-recommended/src/gateway/shared-pom.xml)

Child-pom: Here we configure all the details specific to the particular proxy.

#### pom-xml Sample

Refer child-pom template [child-pom](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/forecastweatherapi-recommended/src/gateway/forecastweatherapi/pom.xml).

**groupId** element's content should match that of the same element in the parent pom.xml. 

**artifactId** element's content should be a unique name, typically set to the folder name or the name of the API.

**name** element's content should match the artifact name.

### Step 3 Create and configure config-json

The config.json acts as your build time configuration modification descriptor. The file's root object is called configurations, configurations is an array of proxy configurations scoped to an environment. Note: it is important that the name of the configurations match the name of the profiles in the parent-pom.

For instance in the example below you have two configurations one for the test profile and one for the production profile. This example also shows how you can use xpath to replace environment specific settings.



#### Config-json Sample

Refer config.json template [config.json] (https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/forecastweatherapi-recommended/src/gateway/forecastweatherapi/config.json)

     **configuration** - an array of API definitions

        **name** - Name of the maven profile

        **proxies** - Array of proxy definitions, directly correlates to the proxies folder in your API Bundle

           **name** - Name of file to configure

           **tokens** - Array of Actions to Invoke on Elements

              **xpath** - Path to element that your want to change the value of

              **value** - The replacement value

        **policies** - Array of proxy definitions, directly correlates to the policies or step definition folder in your API Bundle

           **name** - Name of file to configure

           **tokens** - Array of Actions to Invoke on Elements

              **xpath** - Path to element that your want to change the value of

              **value** - The replacement value

        **targets** - Array of proxy definitions, directly correlates to the proxies folder in your API Bundle

           **name** - Name of file to configure

           **tokens** - Array of Actions to Invoke on Elements

              **xpath** - Path to element that your want to change the value of

              **value** - The replacement value


Deploy and run the scripts



## Commands for deploying the proxy using maven

*To deploy the proxy*

/src/gateway/proxy-dir
(run the command from the directory same as child pom)

**mvn apigee-enterprise:deploy -P -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<password>**

For example:

mvn apigee-enterprise:deploy -P prod -Dusername=admin@toopowerful.com -Dpassword=too\_powerful\_password

*To deploy the proxy and run jmeter tests*

**mvn install -P  <profile_name> -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<password>**



## Advanced Configuration Options

**Note 1:** The following entries in some XML file elements could be changed to match the customer's environment: "groupId", "id" (for each profile sections), "apigee.profile", "apigee.env", "apigee.hosturl", "apigee.org". The contents of "apigee.profile", "apigee.env", and "id" elements should match the profile the customer wants to use and is matched with environment name. The value of the "apigee.hosturl" element should match the value in the example if the customer is an enterprise cloud user. If the customer is an on premise user, this url would be the location of the customer management servers host and port. The port is 8080 by default. The value of the "apigee.org" element should match the organization provided when Customer environment was initially setup, in most cases this includes the name of the company. For on premise installations, the org is setup when you run installation scripts. The Maven group id is malleable and is also marked in red for both pom examples, the only thing you should note when changing this is that they need to be consistent between applications.

**Note 2:** The"apigee.override.delay", "apigee.delay,apigee.options" are optional elements. The "apigee.override.delay" could be specified (in milliseconds). This will ensure to add a delay between the operations like delete, import, activate, deactivate etc.

**Note 3:** The "apigee.options" element can have the following values: **clean** (this option will delete the last deployed revision in an environment), **validate** (this option will validate a bundle before importing. Thus if you want strict validation then its required), **inactive** (this option will import the bundle without activating the bundle), **override** (this option is used for seamless deployment and should be supplied with apigee.override.delay parameter. The apigee.override.delay expects delay to be given in seconds), **update** (this option will update the deployed revision. This is similar to import with validation but no new revision is created. If there are any errors in the bundle, an error is thrown and the existing bundle is left intact. In case the revision they are trying to update is deployed, it will internally trigger undeployment and deployment. It is completely in the background and not visible in the response. **It is not advised to update the deployed revision** . (UI could show a warning or something in this case).

**Note 4:** The "apigee.options" combination could be given with comma separated values. The precedence order of options are -> override, update, (clean, inactive, validate, force). 

**Note 5:** Flow without "apigee.options":import –> undeploy (lastactive) –> deploy (new revision)
